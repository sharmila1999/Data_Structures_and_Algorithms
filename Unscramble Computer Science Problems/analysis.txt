Task 0: O(1)
Code will always execute in the same amount of time, regardless of the input data.

Task 1: O(N)
Execution time will grow linearly, in direct proportion to the input data.

Task 2: O(N)
Execution time will grow linearly, in direct proportion to the input data.

Task 3: O(N log N)
Execution time for the bulk of the code will grow linearly, in direct proportion to the input data. However, the `sorted` function has a complexity of `O(n log n)`, which affects the overall efficiency of the code.

Task 4: O(N log N)
Execution time for the bulk of the code will grow linearly, in direct proportion to the input data. However, the `sorted` function has a complexity of `O(n log n)`, which affects the overall efficiency of the code.
